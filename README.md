# Vehicle Access Control System (VAC)
Vehicle Access Control System for Gated Communities with License Plate Recognition Based on Progressive Web Application

# Motivation
The project is inspired by the exising system implemented in most of the gated communities which is using electronic access card to access the gated communities.

The existing system might be fine for the residents but it might be troublesome and time-consuming for the visitors to access the gated communities. 

The proposed system is powered by the license plate recognition (LPR) technology which can detects and identify the vehicle's license plate to grant access accordingly.

The access lists are managed by the residents which means that the residents are the one who decide if the visitors are allowed to access the gated communities easily through their license plates registered.

The visitors could make a request for access through the web application that requires approval from the residents.

The residents are responsible for either approving their own visitors' request for access or add the visitors to their whitelist to grant access.

The security management office could make use of the web application to monitor the records of visits, records of vehicles' entry and exit and so on.
